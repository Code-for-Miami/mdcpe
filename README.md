## How
#### Install
To set up your local database with Miami-Dade County’s data, please follow the
instructions below:

A rake task as been included (listed as ‘populate_database.rake’) with this
project. This task is responsible for populating your local database with county’s
data.


1. Open your terminal application and run `git clone https://github.com/RickyGonzJr/mdcpe` to clone this project onto your computer.

2. `cd` into your mdcpe folder.

3. Run `rake db:migrate` to create your table.

4. Run `rake populate_database:permits` to populate your table with Miami-Dade County’s permit data. This process will take some time. You can limit how many rows of data you decide to pull down by adjusting the `$limit` value in the HTTParty response. If you’d like to pull down all of the data, simply remove this value.
