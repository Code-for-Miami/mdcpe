2. Inside populate_database.rake is a rails generate command for generating your model
(this project defaults to the name ‘Permit’ for the model).

3. Run the rails g command exactly as printed to create your database.

4. Once your Permit model is created, execute the populate_database.rake task to
populate your local database. This may take some time.
